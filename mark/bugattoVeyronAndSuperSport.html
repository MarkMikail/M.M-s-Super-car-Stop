<h1>About The Bugatti Veyron/Super Sport</h1>

<p><b>The original version has a top speed of 407 km/h <br> (253 mph). It was named Car of the Decade and best car award (2000–2009) 
by the BBC television programme Top Gear. The standard Bugatti <br> Veyron also won Top Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005.

The Super Sport version of the Veyron is recognised by Guinness <br>World Records as the fastest street-legal production car in the w
orld, with a top speed of 430.9 km/h (267.7 mph).

The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuss, and the exterior was <br>designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen, with much of the engineering 
work being conducted under the guidance of engineering chief Wolfgang<br> Schreiber.

Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti <br> began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior 
and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on <br> the marque's official website. The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014.</b>
