<h1>About The Bugatti Veyron/Super Sport</h1>

<p><b>The Agera R made its debut at the <br> March 2011 Geneva Motor Show
-with a Speed Racer livery theme, and special Michelin tyres. It can accelerate <br>from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and 
reach a theoretical top
 speed of 439 km/h (273 mph). The<br> Agera R has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.37,
 or Cd=0.33 at high speed due to its adaptive rear wing, <br>while producing 300 kg
 (660 lb) of downforce at 250 km/h (155 mph). This adaptive rear wing system is lig
 hter than <br>conventional hydraulic/electrical adaptive systems, and has the unique 
 ability to compensate for<br> head/tailwind due to its spring-loaded design. Furthermore, 
 the pylons holding the wing play not only a role <br>in the Agera R's aerodynamic performance, 
 but also assist in extracting hot air from the engine<br> bay. On 2 September 2011, during test 
 sessions in<br> Ã„ngelholm, the Agera R broke six world land speed records for a production car,
 including 0-300 km/h <br>(0-186 mph) in 14.53 seconds, and 0-300-0 km/h in only 21.19 seconds.
 The braking performance required <br>to maintain this record is enabled in part by the Agera's 
 stability, demonstrated by Koenigsegg's test driver and <br>drivetrain technician Robert Serwanski, 
 who was recorded by passenger <br> Rob Ferretti (founder of the group "Super Speeders") braking from 
 300 km/h to 0 without holding the steering wheel. The Agera R can produce lateral cornering forces 
 <br>of 1.5 G, due to a combination of mechanical balance 
and high levels of grip from the specially <br>developed Michelin Supersport tyres.</b>
